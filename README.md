#### Wait

Get the latest artist and album that have received Best New Music from [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com).  It's like an unofficial Python API!

Because sometimes you're just like "what's the latest best new music from p-fork," right?!

Note that this is just regex'ing raw HTML, so may break if the structure of [this page](http://pitchfork.com/best) changes.

#### What
Clone the repo or just paste the python into a .py file, then run from the command line!  It should echo the most recent Best New Artist and Album.  On August 22, 2013 this is Julianna Barwick, Nepenthe.
