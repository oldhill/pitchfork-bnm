NOTE: this probably doesn't really work.  Just trying out Python's [urllib2](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html)...

Uses regex to return the latest artist who has received Best New Album from [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com)

Because sometimes you're just like "who's the latest artist to receive best new album" right?!
