A tiny Python library, providing functions to get the latest artist and album that have received Best New Music from [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com).  It's like an unofficial Python API!

Because sometimes you're just like "what's the latest best new music" right?!

Note that this is regex'ing raw HTML, so may break if the structure of [this page](http://pitchfork.com/best) changes.
